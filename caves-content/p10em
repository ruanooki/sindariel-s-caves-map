    <h3>Path 10 of Eye Middle</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>You follow the middle path that was decorated with an engraving of an eye. A tiny cavern is hollowed out on the wall path 
        directly to the left, while the end of the path eventually opens up to a larger cavern. Searching the path, you find a couple 
        of crystal birds.</p>
