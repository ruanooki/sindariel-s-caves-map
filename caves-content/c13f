    <h3>Cavern 13 of Feather</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>After following the path engraved with a feather, you find yourself at the south side of a large cavern. Some of the stones have 
        been stacked up to make a sort of workbench, and you can see the broken remains of what was once a magic laboratory on these 
        makeshift workbenches. Within the cavern you find a handful of crystal birds.</p>

    <p>Magic Laboratory: 
        <span class="item-description"> Broken glass shows there were once bottles here, and crystals are here as well to store magical 
            energy. There are also books, but most are motheaten and water damaged so badly they are unreadable. Only one page on the 
            workbench gives you information of note 'The eye is here but it's not enough. It's only one piece. It needs to be inserted 
            into something that can channel its power.'</span>
    </p>

    <p>Workbench: 
        <span class="item-description"> A long workbench made of carefully stacked pale stones that you can find within the caves. Most 
            of the stuff on top is unusable, but you do manage to find a page with writing. All it says is 'The eye is here but it's 
            not enough. It's only one piece. It needs to be inserted into something that can channel its power.'</span>
