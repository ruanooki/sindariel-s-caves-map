    <h3>Cavern 13 of Eye</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>After following the path engraved with an eye symbol, you find yourself at the west side of a huge, round cavern. At the center of 
        it is a massive crystalline pillar that stretches from the floor to the ceiling, and in the center of the crystalline pillar is a 
        small, turqouise sphere, only about the size of a walnut. You find little else in this room except for a stone marked with a 
        symbol and a k8. Perahps this Symbol Stone K8 will be of use.</p>

    <p>Cystalline pillar: 
        <span class="item-description">This huge pillar is cyndrilical and perfectly clear. Inside of it is a small turquoise sphere. 
            You find when drawing too close you are filled with a sense of dread, and are unable to bring yourself to even touch the 
            pillar.</span>
    </p>

    <p>Turquoise sphere: 
        <span class="item-description">This small sphere in the center of a pillar of crystal is only about the size of a walnut. It is 
            entirely a deep, gemlike turquoise color except for a slash of black in the front like that of a cat's iris. Getting too 
            close to it fills you with a sense of dread, and you find you are not even able to touch the pillar that encases it.'</span>
