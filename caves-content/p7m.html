    <h3>Path 7 of Mushroom</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>This path was one of the paths that led away from the small cavern with the altar. Many glowing mushrooms line it, and 
        it's long and twisty until it eventually hits a fork. The forward path is marked with an engraving of a tree, while the 
        left path continues to grow thick with mushrooms. Among the mushrooms you find a couple of crystal birds.</p>

    <p>Glowing mushrooms: 
        <span class="item-description">The mushrooms glow with a pale light. Even when picked, the light doesn't fade, though you 
            notice the mushroom is covered in a sticky substance which occasionally has small insects trapped in it. If you 
            roll lore, and get one success, you know these are miner's guardian mushrooms. Once picked, their light will last for 
            3 more weeks, and it will last even longer than that if you feed them insects. Not only that, they're edible, though 
            the taste is somewhat sour and unpleasant. These mushrooms have saved many a lost miner from starvation.</span>
