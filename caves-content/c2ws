    <h3>Cave 2 of Water and Shadow</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>The tunnel from the entrance extends into a larger, round cavern, filled with stones. There are two paths to choose from now, one 
        leading to the west, and one to the north. To the north is a wide path from which you can hear the sound of rushing water, and to 
        the west is a thin path, the stones within in odd formation that cast ghoulish dancing shadows when exposed to the light of flame.
        Searching this place, you manage to find some crystalline birds.</p>
