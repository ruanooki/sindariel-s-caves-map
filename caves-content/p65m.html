    <h3>Path 6.5 of Moon</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>This is the southmost path of a small cavern that had 4 paths leading from it in different directions. There is a moon 
        engraved on the floor. Otherwise the path is short and insignificant. There is a glimmer behind that stone though. 
        A crystal bird?</p>
