    <h3>Star Cavern 6 of Mushroom, Crystal and Moon</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>After following a path that had a star engraved on the floor, you arrive at a cavern that has a large altar at the center 
        of it, with a suit of armor standing before it. You followed the path from the east of the cavern, and notice there are 
        two to the north, and one to the south. The path to the south has a crescent moon engraved in the floor, while the left 
        path to the north seems to be covered in glowing mushrooms, and the right path to the north looks to be covered in 
        pale crystals.</p>

    <p>Armor: 
        <span class="item-description">The armor looks decidedly familiar if you recall a certain night that wielded a broom. 
            The armor, however, sits unmoving now, except for the uncanny sound of a heartbeat thudding within its frozen chest.</span>
    </p>
        
    <p>Altar: 
        <span class="item-description">The altar is large and takes up much of the space. 
            A large star is engraved in the center of it-- large enough for someone to lie there and have 
            each of their limbs in each point.</span>
    </p>
        
    <p>Crystals: 
        <span class="item-description">The crystals here reflect iridescent light. 
            Some are perfectly prism shaped, and it covers the area is beautiful little rainbows.</span>
    </p>
        
    <p>Mushrooms: 
        <span class="item-description">The mushrooms glow with a pale light. Even when picked, the light doesn't fade, 
            though you notice the mushroom is covered in a sticky substance which occasionally has small insects trapped in it. 
            If you roll lore, and get one success, you know these are miner's guardian mushrooms. Once picked, their light will 
            last for 3 more weeks, and it will last even longer than that if you feed them insects. Not only that, they're edible, 
            though the taste is somewhat sour and unpleasant. These mushrooms have saved many a lost miner from starvation.</span>
