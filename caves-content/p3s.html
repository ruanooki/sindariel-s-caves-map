    <h3>Path 3 of Shadow</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>The path is thin and twisting, and odd rock formations make any lights held cast twisted, ghoulish shadows. 
        Sometimes the shadows seem to move... or perhaps, they really are. Small shadowy weasel like creatures bound out from behind 
        some stones, hissing and revealing needle like teeth. You manage to fight them off. 
        (@wisp for 10 xp of a character of your choice. If you wish to rp fighting, their stats are: VIT: 3, PHYS: 5. 
        Dark magic will do 1/2 damage, while Light magic will do 2X damage. 
        It is recommended to run 4 at minimum and 9 at maximum.)</p>
