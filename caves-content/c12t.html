    <h3>Cavern 12 of Tree</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>This cavern is humongous-- so large that it will take days to explore. Even more breathtaking though, is the forest of glowing 
        blue-white trees that fills it, and the carpet of glowing blue moss below. An entire forest is in a cave, filled with flowers, 
        streams, ponds, and the like. Furred animals seem to live here as well. There's a calm to this place, though sometimes when 
        walking through you feel as if you're being watched. To the southwest there's a tiny cavern. By one of the trees you find a 
        stone marked with a symbol, and with a9. Perhaps this Symbol Stone A9 will be of use.</p>

    <p>Moss: 
        <span class="item-description">The moss is soft beneath your feet, and glows with a blue light. Other than the blue and the light, 
            it seems like normal moss.</span>
    </p>

    <p>Trees: 
        <span class="item-description">The trees of the cavern forest glow with a blue-white light. They seem to be of some deciduous 
            variety, and when their leaves fall to the mossy ground the light dims somewhat. It's a breathtaking and alien sight.</span>
    </p>

    <p>Animals: 
        <span class="item-description">The animals of the cavern forest are exactly the animals you might see in a forest above 
            ground--deer, squirrels, foxes, chipmunks-- except with a few notable difference. Most notable is their pelts seem to 
            be blue, and that their eyes and other features seem to glow with white. They're edible if one tries to eat them. If you 
            wish to tame one, you may simply say your character has done so.</span>
