    <h3>Path 8 of Mushroom</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>After following a path filled with mushrooms, you decide to continue to follow the mushroom path that had curved to the 
        left. The path seems to fork at the end revealing two more mushroom laden paths-- one to the left, and one to the right. 
        Among the mushrooms you find a stone marked with a symbol and an a1. Perhaps this Symbol Stone A1 will be of use.</p>

    <p>Glowing mushrooms: 
        <span class="item-description">The mushrooms glow with a pale light. Even when picked, the light doesn't fade, though you 
            notice the mushroom is covered in a sticky substance which occasionally has small insects trapped in it. If you 
            roll lore, and get one success, you know these are miner's guardian mushrooms. Once picked, their light will last for 
            3 more weeks, and it will last even longer than that if you feed them insects. Not only that, they're edible, though 
            the taste is somewhat sour and unpleasant. These mushrooms have saved many a lost miner from starvation.</span>
