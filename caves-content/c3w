            <p>From the cavern previous, you decided to follow the sound of rushing water and now find yourself in another large cavern. 
                At the far end of it, a glassy pool takes up much of the space, its surface rippling softly from the waterfall pouring 
                into it from the back. A nearby stone scrapes your leg, but as water drips onto it you notice the wound close. It 
                couldn't hurt to take some of this.</p>

            <p>From the cavern previous, you decided to follow the sound of rushing water and now find yourself in another large cavern. 
                At the far end of it, a glassy pool takes up much of the space, its surface rippling softly from the waterfall pouring 
                into it from the back. Suddenly, the surface starts to break and roil, and you see the top of a human head peek out, its 
                pale opalescent eyes staring at you. It needs only a glance before a long limbed creature starts to crawl out of the 
                depths, its jaw unhinging to show sharpened teeth. (Shamblers are crawling out of the pool. You may choose to take 10xp 
                now, or if you wish to moderate a fight you may bring three others with you. Use the &lt;!monst shambler&gt; command to see the 
                Shambler's stats..)</p>

            <p>A pool rests before you, glowing with a pale light, and rippling from the waterfall splashing into it. You move to take a 
                closer look, but slip on a wet stone, and plunge into the water. Beneath you, you see the bottom pool is covered in 
                skeletons-- white, and glimmering beneath the water. A voice murmurs in your ear "Get out!" and you struggle to the 
                surface. When you finally make it, you find an odd ring in your hand.</p>
