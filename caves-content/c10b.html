    <h3>Cavern 10 of Bone</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>This cavern was embedded in the wall to the west of the large cavern the crystal path led to. It's quite small, only about as 
        large as a bedroom, but what's notable about it is that its pale stone walls are slathered in dried blood. The walls, the 
        ceiling. Sometimes the blood seems to form odd symbols, other times it looks to be smeared handprints. You find a red crusted 
        crystal bird among the red. When you touch it, faint images of a man holding a sword high drift past you, and a soft voice 
        whispers: <i>"Draw the centipede symbol on the right leg."</i> The voice fades, and the centipede symbol appears in your mind for 
        just a moment before disappearing.</p>
