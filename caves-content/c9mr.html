            <p>You've followed the Mushroom path for a while, and when you hit a fork, you opted for the one on the left. This one 
                immediately opens into a large cavern, and at the center sits a massive glowing mushroom. Occasionally it releases 
                sparkling spores that seem to vibrate with magic energy. It couldn't hurt to take some of those.</p>

            <p>Massive glowing mushroom: 
                <span class="item-description">This massive glowing mushroom looks like all the others except much larger. Perhaps its the 
                    source of all the little mushrooms, or perhaps some spell made it grow to this size. The glow is now sickly, and a 
                    large gash oozing an inky black is in its stem.<span>
