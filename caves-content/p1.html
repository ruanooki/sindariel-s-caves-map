    <h3>Path 1</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>The light shines behind you as you just enter Death's pale caves. The stone is smooth, rounded from nature, and the path 
        beckons you forward until something catches your attention. It looks to be a gray stone with an odd symbol carved on it, 
        as well as an R. Perhaps this Symbol Stone R will be of use.</p>
