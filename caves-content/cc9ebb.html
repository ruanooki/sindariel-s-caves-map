    <h3>Crystal Cavern 9 of Eye, Blood and Bone</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>There was a fork in the crystal path, but it didn't seem to matter as both paths lead to the south side of this massive cavern. 
        Pale crystals grow over the floor, walls, and ceiling, some so large you can't see the top as it disappears into the depths of 
        the huge cavern, some so tiny they are smaller than the nail of your thumb. This cavern is so large it would take days to explore 
        its entirety, but you are able to find the exits. Other than the two paths you arrived from, there appears to be a tiny cavern 
        hollowed out on the west side, red and stained with old blood. To the north there are three paths. The one on the left has its 
        entryway decorated with an archway of bones. The one in the middle has an engraving of an eye on the ground, as does the one to 
        the right. As you explore, you manage to find a stone with a symbol marked on it, as well as t6. Perhaps this Symbol Stone T6 
        will be of use.</p>

    <p>Crystals: 
        <span class="item-description"> The crystals here reflect iridescent light. Some are perfectly prism shaped, and it covers the 
            area in beautiful little rainbows.<span>
    </p>

    <p>Archway of bones: 
        <span class="item-description">Somebody crafted this. The bones are tightly locked in with one another so that this structure won't easily fall. 
            It's a gruesome path marking.</span>
