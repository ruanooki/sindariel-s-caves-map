            <p>After following the middle path that was decorated with an engraving of an eye, you decide to look within the small cavern 
                that was hollowed out in the left wall. The cavern is small, and smooth walled, and in the center of it is a large black 
                box with a keyhole in the lid.</p>

            <p>Suddenly, you hear a disappointed voice in your head. "You haven't found one of my keys. I'm afraid I'll have to stay shut 
                then. Shut for years and years when I have so many gifts to give." No matter what you do, the box won't open, nor does it 
                speak to you again.</p>
            <hr>

            <p>Large black box: 
                <span class="item-description"> The box is about as large as a seaman's chest, and its made of some cool shining black material. 
                    A small keyhole sits in the center of the front of the lid, and gold letters spell out 'Baelan's Magic Box' on the center of 
                    the top of the lid. The box seems affixed to the ground, as if you try to lift it, it stays shut.</span>

                taking that." The old key you've held onto for all this time suddenly flies out of where you've been keeping it, then 
                flashes into a sphere of gold light that swirls into the keyhole before disappearing. With that, the box clicks open, 
                revealing the treasure inside for you to take. Once taken, the box will click shut to be locked again.</p>
