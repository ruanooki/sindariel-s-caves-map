    <h3>Cavern 11 of Bone</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>After following the path that was decorated with an archway of bones, you find that it ends in a medium sized cavern. The 
        cavern is mostly empty, except for a large black door. There is also a small stone on the ground with a symbol marked on 
        it, along with Y8. Perhaps this Symbol Stone Y8 will be of use.</p>

    <p>Large black door: 
        <span class="item-description">The door opens with an easy push, and reveals polished black bricks in a square room. It 
            appears this door connects Sindariel's caves to Streiya's Labyrinth.</span>
