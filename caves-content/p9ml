            <p>You've followed the Mushroom path for a while, and when you hit a fork, you opted for the one on the left. Here, the 
                mushrooms part, and in the center of them sits a glowing red flower, then there are more flowers, and more. A sickly 
                smell of rot clouds the air, and you realize the flowers are growing on corpses.</p>

            <p>Glowing red flower: 
                <span class="item-description"> This is an ominous looking flower with many thin petals. Its stem is a pale blue.  If 
                    you manage to roll a lore of three, you know that this flower is known as Parthu flower, and if you find them, 
                    there's often a monster called a Parthu nearby that will collect corpses for the flowers to grow on. You also know 
                    that the flower is the only cure for whiteeye-- a disease that turns your irises a milky white, and that shows you 
                    ominous visions while it sickens and kills you.</span>
