    <h3>Shadow Cavern 4 of Moon and Shadow</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>This small cavern has two paths to the west of it. Someone has engraved a star in the floor of the stone on the path 
        to the right, while a crescent moon has been engraved on the floor of the stone on the path to the left. 
        Searching further, you find a glimmering crystal bird on the ground.
