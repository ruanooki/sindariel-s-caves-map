    <h3>Eye Cavern 11 of Sword and Feather</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>Following either one of the paths engraved with an eye takes you to the south side of a fairly large cavern. There are two more 
        paths that lead from it to the north. The left path has a feather engraved on the floor, while the right path has a sword 
        engraved on the floor. You find an odd stone with a symbol on it, as well as w9 on it. Perhaps this Symbol Stone W9 will be 
        of use. You also find a crystal bird.Following either one of the paths engraved with an eye takes you to the south side of
