    <h3>Path 7.5 of Moon</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>This was a path that was directly east from the large cavern previous. 
        It is straight, and narrow, and seems not to be horribly long. 
        In a alcove there's a statue of Sindariel, and in her mouth is a crystal bird. 
        When you touch it, faint images of a man holding a helmet drift past you, and a soft voice whispers: 
        <i>"Draw the moth symbol on the right arm."</i> The voice fades, and the moth symbol appears in your mind for 
        just a moment before disappearing.</p>
