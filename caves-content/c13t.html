    <h3>Cavern 13 of Tree</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>This is a tiny cavern that has been hollowed out on the southwest wall of the massive forest cavern. It looks to have been used 
        as a little room once. A decayed bed sits in one wall, and in another alcove above it sits another decayed bed. The remains of 
        a stove and some pots is here as well. There's also a rusted sword, and the tattered remains of a toy bear.</p>

    <p>Decayed bed: 
        <span class="item-description">Both beds are molded and tattered, and look only slightly more palatable than the stone to 
            sleep on. You can imagine that once they were nice though, as they seem to be stuffed with wool and made of decent 
            cloth.</span>

    <p>Toy bear: 
        <span class="item-description">A plush bear sewn of checkered cloth. This was most certainly a child's toy once, and it 
            was sitting on the upper bed. What an odd thing to find down here.</span>
    </p>

    <p>Stove: 
        <span class="item-description">Only some ashes remain in this little clay stove.</span>
    </p>

    <p>Rusted sword: 
        <span class="item-description">Its far too rusted to be used for its intended purpose. However, there looks to have been a 
            name etched in the leather on the hilt. The first letters are too faded, but the last two letters are an L and an A.</span>
