    <h3>Mausoleum</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>The odd caves of Sindariel's Mausoleum twist and turn, the stone pale and smooth against your fingertips. 
        You get lost in the darkness, and soon find yourself back at the entrance after having found nothing except 
        a crystal bird on the path.</p>
