    <h3>Cavern 8 of Moon</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>Following a path from the north with a moon engraved on it, you arrived in a large cavern, and are now exploring the 
        bottom half. You notice a path to the south. There is a crescent pool in the ground, and its surface is glassy still. 
        You notice the ceiling above has thousands of colorful points of light, like stars, and that the pool reflects it perfectly. 
        Something about this water is oddly refreshing, and you take some with you.</p>

    <p>Moon:
        <span class="item-description"> The moon engraved on the floor of the path is just that. A stone engraving.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p>Crescent pool: 
        <span class="item-description"> Its surface has a calm and glassy stillness, and reflects the tiny points of light that are 
            on the ceiling. The water is clear and sweet.</span>
    </p>

    <p>Points of light:
        <span class="item-description"> You notice a worm on the wall whose tail glows with light. This must be the source of it.</span>
