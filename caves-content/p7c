    <h3>Path 7 of Crystal</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>This path was the right path to the north that led from that odd cavern with the altar and the armor. Pale crystals line 
        the walls, floor and ceiling, giving the entire area a jagged, glimmering look. The path soon forks to the left and right. 
        Both paths look the same. They both sparkle with crystals. On the ground you find a couple of crystal birds.</p>

        <span class="item-description"> The crystals here reflect iridescent light. Some are perfectly prism shaped, and it covers the 
            area in beautiful little rainbows.<span>
