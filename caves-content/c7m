    <h3>Cavern 7 of Moon</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>Following a path from the north with a moon engraved on it, you arrive in a large cavern, 
        so large that you can't see the other end of it in the darkness. You can, however, tell that there is a path 
        directly to the east. Giving this place a quick lookover, you discover a handful of crystal birds.</p>
