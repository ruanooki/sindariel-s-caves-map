    <h3>Cavern 7.5 of Moon</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>Following the short path that led from a large cavern previous, you arrive in a smaller cavern. What catches your 
        attention first is a large statue of bones, a green glimmer shines from one of its eyes. Inspecting the glimmer 
        more closely, you find a small earring.</p>

    <p>Statue of Bones:
        <span class="item-description">This grisly statue seems to be doing its best to mimic the form of a humanoid being with 
            butterfly wings. It's large, about 6 feet tall, and the bony wings look delicate.<span>
