    <h5>Gem of Knowledge: </h5>

    <p>This odd red gem is warm when you touch it, and sometimes you hear whispers you can't quite make out. It seems to give the world around you greater clarity.</p>

    <p>This item gives ACA +1 for academics skill rolls. This cannot be equipped at the same time as the gem of imagination, and can only be switched out once per day.</p>
