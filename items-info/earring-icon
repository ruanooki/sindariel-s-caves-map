    <h5>Earring of Disguise: </h5>
            
    <p>When wearing this earring, for 8 hours per day you may change your hair color, hair style, 
        and eye color. It also seems to contain the power to hide mer, feroxi, elemental, and draconic features such as wings, 
        horns, tails, or scales. You can even choose to look more masculine, or more feminine. Those with moderate or greater 
        light magic sensing abilities will be able to see through the disguise. Those with minor light magic sensing abilities 
        will be able to tell a magical item is at work.</p>
