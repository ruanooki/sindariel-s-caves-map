    <p class="mb-3">As soon as you lift the stone to take a closer look, a crackling voice starts to play from it:</p>

    <p class="fst-italic">"I'm Remira Flin, and it's day eighteen of exploring the sealed caves. Mikey has brought the fae daughter. I've never seen her up 
        close, but she appears haunted and haggard. She seems withdrawn, but who wouldn't be after experiencing the horrors above, 
        especially if you're so young. She clutches onto a stuffed bear given to her by Mikey, and rarely says more than a word to me. 
        Hopefully her time in the caves will restore some of her joy."</p>
