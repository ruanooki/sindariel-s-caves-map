    <p class="fst-italic">"I'm Remira Flin, and it's day seventeen of exploring the sealed caves. I've missed recording on the past 6 days. Much of it has 
        been spent exploring one of these massive caverns, but... a lot has happened. I've found Mikey to be a wonderful traveling 
        companion. He is compassionate, and genuinely interested in this place, but after a couple of days of travel I've heard his 
        true intentions for wanting to come down here. He has been caring for the fae daughter that was abandoned, and fears that she 
        will be killed in retaliation for the pillage of Raehn. She doesn't deserve such a fate, and his suggestion was that he bring 
        her down here to hide until things calm down. I asked if things will ever calm down, but he seems convinced that the priestess 
        will have a way to stop the slaughter. I considered it for a while, and decided there would be no harm in hiding the fae daughter 
        in some of the earlier caves. He suggested that small cavern near the forest that he was interested in earlier. That would indeed 
        be a good place. There's plenty of food, and water, and the forest is beautiful and peaceful. He's not with me now. He left as 
        soon as I gave my agreement to protect her here to fetch her. I hope... that I've made the right decision, but it would be 
        monstrous to stand by and let an innocent die, wouldn't it?"</p>
