    <p class="fst-italic">"I'm Remira Flin, and it's day eleven of exploring the sealed caves. I missed recording on day 10 due to backtracking my way 
        here. I've found another huge cavern-- one as large as the forest cavern, but this one is covered in crystals instead of trees. 
        The crystals here seem to be a particularly good medium for storing magic. If they're everywhere underground, maybe that'd 
        explain why Raehn is one of the locations that sygaldry is possible? I've posited this hypothesis to Mikey, but he seems 
        uninterested, and nervous. I've asked him why he decided to abandon the fighting against the fae, and he told me the conflict 
        is a slaughter, and he can see no end to it. The angry fae seem to refuse to have anything to do with the fae that appeared in 
        Raehn, and the one they stole is gone, as are those others that they burned in that horrible ritual. He says he feels sympathy 
        for the fae daughter. She's lost everything, and faces only hatred from all sides. There's nowhere for her to go. How will Raehn 
        escape this?"</p>
