    <p class="mb-3">As soon as you lift the stone to take a closer look, a crackling voice starts to play from it:</p>

    <p class="fst-italic">"I'm Remira Flin, and it's day two of exploring the sealed caves. I've found a small circular cavern 
        with four paths leading different ways. I've decided to call it the star cavern, because its small and circular, 
        and has 4 paths leading from it that give it a star shape. Kind of? Often I feel as if I'm being watched but when 
        I search for the source of the eyes I find nothing. Perhaps it is my apprehension about the archmage being somewhere 
        within. The Priestess has offered to send military support with me, but my gut tells me that would do more harm than 
        good. The soldiers are needed to keep out the fae, anyhow. This cave is also full of wonders, and I'd hate to see 
        soldiers trample over them without a care."</p>
