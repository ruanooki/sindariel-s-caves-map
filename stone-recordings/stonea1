    <p class="mb-3">As soon as you lift the stone to take a closer look, a crackling voice starts to play from it:</p>

    <p class="fst-italic">"I'm Remira Flin, and it's day nine of exploring the sealed caves. The past 5 days I have been unable to make a recording due 
        to being absorbed in exploring this forest cavern. It's massive, and it seems to be peaceful. During that time, I have also 
        decided to allow Mikey to join me for this exploration. He seems truly invested in discovering what lies below here, and has 
        promised he'll be careful with the area. He despises his new nickname, but puts up with it because I think he realizes how 
        wonderful it is to be able to escape down here. He's also enamored with the forest cavern, and has expressed particular 
        interest in a small cavern to the south of it. I'm not certain why. It appears to be completely empty. I've heard news that 
        the fae have escalated, and stolen a Myrenn child in retaliation. I can only pray that he will be returned."</p>
