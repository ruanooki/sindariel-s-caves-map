    <p class="mb-3">As soon as you lift the stone to take a closer look, a crackling voice starts to play from it:</p>

    <p class="fst-italic">"I'm Remira Flin, and it's day nineteen of exploring the sealed caves. It's gone wrong. It's all gone wrong. You can't trust any 
        fae, it seems. I've found the cavern with the weapon, and I've found Baelan. He seems to think that the weapon isn't enough, and 
        that it needs something else to function. I was willing to discuss with him his reasons for seeking out the weapon since it might 
        be our only salvation, but before we could do so the fae daughter drained his assistant of blood. I can't find Mikey anywhere. We 
        have to escape. We must. But she's watching the exit."</p>
