    <p class="mb-3">As soon as you lift the stone to take a closer look, a crackling voice starts to play from it:</p>

    <p class="fst-italic">"I'm Remira Flin, and it's day twenty of exploring the sealed caves. Baelan and I have found a door that leads 
        to a... labyrinth of sorts. It seems this way might be our only escape from these caves. There's a light in Baelan's eyes. He 
        seems convinced that the other half of the weapon might be here. If we can't escape, maybe we can at least use that to defend 
        ourselves. I hope Mikey is alright.</p>
