    <p class="mb-3">As soon as you lift the stone to take a closer look, a crackling voice starts to play from it:</p>

    <p class="fst-italic">"I'm Remira Flin, and it's day three of exploring the sealed caves. I've now decided to explore the paths marked with a moon. 
        They seemed to lead to a large cavern, in which there was a beautiful pool shaped exactly like a crescent moon within. 
        I'm now leaving that place through the south path, and I still see no sign of Baelan or Quint-- the hostage he took. 
        I've come to view these caverns as a source of peace, as relations with the fae worsen each day. Why did that fae come here 
        of all places? Why are the rest of the fae so angry? People are dying every day now. It's far more dangerous up there than 
        down here. Baelan said there was something here that could fight the fae. Was he right? Was it the right decision to unseal 
        this place?"</p>
