        here, but isn't it amazing? An entire forest underground. Someone could live down here if they desired. Methurin, I might 
        if the conflict above gets any worse. One of the knights asked about joining my exploration of this place. He seems nice 
        enough, but part of me wonders if he simply wants to avoid the fighting. I guess I can't entirely blame him for that, but 
        now more than ever is when we need fighters, and I've heard he's one of the best swordsmen that the priestess has got. What 
        was his name again? Mi... Mi something."</p>
